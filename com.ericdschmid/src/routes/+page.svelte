    <p class="m-7">Eric Schmid is a multimedia journalist based in St. Louis with 5+ years experience primarily in print-, digital-, and audio-focused newsrooms. 
        He has demonstrated success developing strong continuing news coverage and producing large scale reporting projects independently and as part 
        of a team. This includes advanced skill with source building, story pitching, public records, long-term coverage planning, interviewing, and 
        audio editing/mixing.</p>
    <p class="m-7">His reporting experience spans from breaking hard news to enterprise and investigative features and he excels at producing content native to 
        digital/print and audio/radio platforms. Eric gravitates toward complicated stories with many moving parts and enjoys the challenge of ingesting 
        and distilling large swaths of information into cohesive, intriguing, and manageable stories. He is adept at covering most topics, though his 
        enterprise work regularly returns to stories about the environment, public policy, and the census and demographics.</p>
    <p class="m-7">Eric joined St. Louis Public Radio in June 2019 as their first ever Metro East Reporter, tasked with expanding and developing the station’s 
        coverage of suburban St. Louis communities east of the Mississippi River. In June 2022, he was promoted to cover economic development across St. 
        Louis, a region of 2.8 million people.</p>
    <p class="m-7">Before joining St. Louis Public Radio, Eric held internships at Fox News Channel, NPR member station WSHU Public Radio, and AccuWeather. He graduated 
        from Stony Brook University in 2018 as the valedictorian of the School of Journalism.</p>
