                <p class="-m-1">I am originally from of Fort Collins, Colorado but found my way to the Midwest, after a brief four-year stop in New York where I graduated from Stony Brook University in 2018.</p> 

                <p class="mt-7">In 2019, I landed in the St. Louis region—Belleville, IL specifically—to establish St. Louis Public Radio’s coverage of the Metro East. I since moved into the City of St. Louis and in 2022 was promoted to cover economic development across the region’s 2.8 million people.</p>

                <p class="mt-7">Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors, and it’s where I like to be when not on assignment. I love everything from a float trip, to finding new hiking trails or just walking through one of St. Louis’ many green spaces.</p>

                <p class="mt-7">I also gravitate to landscape and nature photography and love the bluffs of the rivers here and the big sky country near Laramie, Wyoming. A major life goal of mine is to photograph the aurora borealis.</p>

                <p class="mt-7">Music is another pillar for me. I grew up listening to jazz and classical and have been playing instruments almost all my life. These days, I play the tenor saxophone and the clarinet.</p>
